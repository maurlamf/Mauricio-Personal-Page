title: NBA Finals by the Numbers... Does Star Power Matter?

# Some Numbers

It's been oft-opined that most casual and non-partisan NBA fans would have preferred a Miami/San Antonio Finals over the plucky upstart Pacers getting a shot at a 'ship. It has even been opined that the NBA organization itself would prefer Miami; after all, logic says that more viewers = more advertisement dollars.

In trying to better understand the logic of these opinions, I have tried to sift through some data to come up with some big picture implications for either. 
When you look at this chart, its pretty clear that NBA Finals viewership has been in decline since Michael Jordan retired for the second time in 1999.

But besides star power, does the quality of the game really matter?

With the benefit of hindsight, we can say the quality of the game doesn't really matter. To make this comparison, we use series length as a proxy for game quality (more games means higher competition). Creating a simple least squares regression, each additional game past 4 (series minimum) adds .26 to the Nielsen rating. A 7 game series will be expected to add a paltry .78 to a Finals series' average Nielsen rating.

# Star Power Matters 

It's pretty clear that star power is actually more important than series length (our proxy for game quality). Here are a few current players compared against Michael Jordan's average rating. 

* Tim Duncan - 8.05
* LeBron James - 8.83
* Kobe Bryant - 10.36
* Michael Jordan - 16.68

The last time that LeBron James and Tim Duncan matched up was a historically low 6.2 Nielsen ratings. Will a larger-market Miami drive a higher rating? Will LeBron's current status as a champion drive large viewership?
